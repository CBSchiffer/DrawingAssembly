# DrawingAssembly

Final Working Script is held in final_assembly.ipynb

The drawings folder contains the images to be used as the front and side view. Checkpoints will be stored in generated folders named after their respective datatypes (e.g. points/, data_clouds/, voxel_grids/ etc.) This also includes the final generated models which will be stored in the meshes/ directory).
